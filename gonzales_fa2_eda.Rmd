## Interpretation of Results

- Positive Relationship at First

Initially, as MAD increases, the median protein level tends to rise.
This suggests that proteins with higher variability (MAD) often have higher median levels.

- Fluctuations and Outliers

There are sharp spikes and drops, particularly around certain proteins (e.g., Perforin has a very high median but moderate MAD).
Some proteins with very small MADs also have widely varying median levels, meaning their variability is low, but their central tendency differs.

- Flattening or Decline at Higher MAD

At higher MAD values, the median levels seem to stabilize or decline slightly.
This could indicate that proteins with high spread (MAD) do not necessarily have high median levels.

- Loess Trend Line (Red, Dashed)

The loess (smoothed) trend suggests a non-linear relationship:
Rising initially (higher MAD, higher median)
Flattening or slightly declining later (higher MAD, more variable but lower median)
